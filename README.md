This utility is written to extract the files from Rise of the Dragon (though it's named WillyBeamishDump.  It can extract the speech for that game, but I haven't really tested it since adding Rise of the Dragon support).  This utility will extract and unpack specific files.  You can place the extracted files in the Rise of the Dragon directory, and the game will use them instead of the data found in the VOLUME files.

This code was quickly written, and assuming a perfect copy of the game (unmodded), so I didn't add any real error detection, where therer probably should be some.
